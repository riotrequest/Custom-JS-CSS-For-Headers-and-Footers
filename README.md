# Custom-JS-CSS-For-Headers-and-Footers
A simple WordPress plugin that allows you to easily insert custom CSS and JS from the WP Dashboard.

I noticed a trend of the existing ones getting more complicated and/or adding premium features. Overall, just making this more complicated than it needs to be.

For the CSS portion, no need to add style tags.
For the JS portion, you do need to include the script tags.
